Hi, I'm a PhD candidate from Michigan State University. I'm currently working in [Braasch Lab](https://www.fishevodevogeno.org) and [Krishnan Lab](https://www.thekrishnanlab.org). I am particularly interested in how to identify and evaluate the molecular basis of rare and complex diseases at individual patient scales. Currently, I'm working on developing computational approaches to (1) characterize the pathology of the patient based on personalized gene networks, (2) prioritize biomedical factors related to the patient using NLP approaches, (3) estimate perturbed networks that capture the disease context in patients, then identify equivalent disease-related genes for further experimental investigation. I hope to build tools to accurately characterize the pathology behind complex diseases and, more importantly, accelerate the process of experimentally identifying genes (and gene networks) in animal models to further characterize impacted cell types, tissue, and emergent phenotypes, and finally prioritize therapeutics.

When I'm not working I like to cook and play video games.
