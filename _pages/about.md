Hi, I'm a PhD candidate from Michigan State University. I'm currently working in [Braasch Lab](https://www.fishevodevogeno.org) and [Krishnan Lab](https://www.thekrishnanlab.org). I am a computational biologist with broad interests in machine learning and statistical methods for single-cell analysis, graph learning, cross-species knowledge transfer, and evolutionary genomics.


My current research focuses on developing computational approaches to:
1. identify mechanisms linking GWAS risk to specific cell populations using single-cell data, and
2. understand how genome duplication has shaped brain cell-type evolution in teleost fishes.


In the longer term, I aim to build methods that integrate diverse omics modalities — including single-cell datasets, interaction profiling, and comparative genomics — to characterize the genetic etiology of complex diseases by integrating omics data from both humans and research organisms, and to study how these molecular systems evolve over time.


When I'm not working I like to cook and play video games.
